You're the orchestrator for the Loyaltybase build — a multi-tenant FMCG trade-loyalty platform (operator: Gifsy).
Repo root: C:\Users\nikun\Loyaltybaseclaude  (git root; branch **develop**). Frontend: `platform/` (thin Next.js).
Backend: `api/` (NestJS + Prisma 7, the source of truth — owns the DB + ALL business logic).

⚠️⚠️ **STATE: P0 · P1 · P2 · Phase S · P3 · P4 · P5 ALL ✅ COMPLETE. NEXT = P6 (Finance: credits, payouts,
visibility, invoicing).** Everything pushed to origin/develop (≤ `51231fc`). 19 gaps resolved (latest #28 via P5).

**Architecture (Phase S, done):** API-first — a dedicated NestJS backend built IN PLACE in `api/` (reused its shell,
deleted its World-A domain, rebuilt the real domain from the platform's `lib/`+schema), consumed by a thin Next.js FE
over a `next.config.ts` proxy (`/api/*` → backend `/v1/*`, wrapped `{success,data}`). FE calls `/api/*` directly —
**never add local `app/api/*` proxy routes** (the proxy already forwards; such routes are shadowed/dead). See
[[architecture-backend-split]] + `docs/spec/04-architecture.md`.

**THE REAL MODEL (owner-confirmed — do not relitigate; [[platform-real-model]]):** sales/achievement = **upload
FINAL amounts per outlet × parameter, NO compute**; segmentation **program = a reporting/filter facet, NOT a
targeting dimension**; no point-tiers, no SKU. Validate any inherited concept against this BEFORE building
([[reconcile-fit-before-build]]) — the codebase still has speculative World-A scaffolding.

**DONE so far (brief — full records in the reconcile docs + memories):**
- **P3 Onboarding & KYC** (`api/src/kyc/*`): two-stage two-lane field-level KYC. Closes #9/#12/#13/#14/#15.
  `reconcile/P3-onboarding-kyc.md` · [[p3-kyc-complete]]. (Touching KYC: enqueue notifications only AFTER the tx
  commits; resolve the primary outlet BEFORE any status flip.)
- **P4 Programs/Targets/Enrollment** (no compute): `KpiDef` · `OutletTarget` + verbatim per-outlet×KPI×month upload ·
  achievement (`/v1/admin/achievements/*`) + pace · enrollment. Schemes ⟂ targets. Closes #6/#10/#29.
  `reconcile/P4-programs-targets-enrollment.md` · [[p4-complete]]. P5 also closed the **P4 test-debt** (stale
  geo-hierarchy wizard tests retired/updated) + added **Download Final Targets export** + **past-month upload lock**.
- **P5 Wallet, points & rewards** (`api/src/{wallet,rewards}/*`): ledger-aware wallet primitives
  (`creditEarn`/`debitRedeem`/`reverse`/`adjust`/`expireDuePoints`) writing `WalletTransaction` **+** `PointsLedger`
  atomically + expiry sweep (**closes #28**); real `RewardCategory`/`RewardCatalog` admin CRUD (retired the
  gift-config JSON blob, #18-gift); redeem → OTP(`REDEMPTION_CONFIRM`) → debit → guarded status lifecycle +
  refund-on-cancel + voucher/tracking fulfilment (inline + bulk Excel); partner wallet/rewards FE + admin
  catalogue/fulfilment FE. Money-path audit caught + fixed real double-spend/oversell bugs (guarded
  PENDING→CONFIRMED claim, one-pending-order OTP binding, guarded stock claim, FIXED_OTP prod-gate, in-tx OTP
  consume, atomic refund claim). `reconcile/P5-wallet-points-rewards.md` · [[p5-complete]].

**NEXT = P6 · Finance: credits, payouts, visibility, invoicing (spec §02 WF2/WF3; 00-MASTER-PLAN §P6).** The money
spine — most High-severity gaps live here. ⚠️ Magnet: **#16** (POINTS awards never credit the wallet — credits
confirm writes `CreditPayoutEntry` only). **P5 already built the IN-path primitive**: P6 6.2 wires credit-confirm →
`walletService.creditEarn` (and reversal → `walletService.reverse`); the wallet/ledger is ready to be called. Tasks:
6.0 reconcile all four finance contexts + lock money-unit (#19) · 6.1 credit fields/batch/confirm · **6.2 credit
POINTS→wallet (#16)** · 6.3 bank-download grouping, separate-UTR for Visibility (#7) · 6.4 UTR upload + dup +
reversal maker-checker · 6.5 redemption payouts + Fund ledger + TDS (#25) — **also settles P5 INR redemptions**
(UPI/BANK_TRANSFER `RedemptionOrder`s link via `PayoutTransaction.redemptionOrderId`; snapshot bank detail from
verified KYC at payout-creation) · 6.6 visibility submit/approve/fraud + two modes (#17) · 6.7 self-bill invoicing +
number lock (#8) + GST from reg-type (#15). **START P6:** confirm on `develop` + dev DB reachable, read
`00-MASTER-PLAN.md §P6` + `MODEL-ALIGNMENT.md`, propose the P6 reconcile before building. Depends on P5 (wallet) + P3
(GST reg-type) + P2 (outlets).

**Residuals carried forward (NOT done — don't assume):**
- **Platform retirement (~P6, ONE unit):** stale `platform/prisma/schema.prisma` + still-live platform Prisma code
  (auth/session/client-config + the proxy-excluded `visibility/submit`+`partner/invoices`[P6] / `admin/kyc`) + the
  ~96 shadowed rollback-net route files + `lib/incentive`/`lib/kyc-approval`. **P5 note: the platform `lib/targets.ts`
  geo-hierarchy + `lib/gifts.ts`/`redemption-store.ts` demos are now dead/legacy but still imported by ~9 FE pages —
  they retire as part of this unit, NOT piecemeal.** ~120 platform files still use Prisma. Also Gap #32 `auth/logout`.
- P5 deferred: **holding/lock period** (schema fields kept — `lockedUntil`/`lockedPoints`/`LOCK_HOLDING`; ~½-day, no
  migration). `lib/invoice` reg-type read = **P6**. WhatsApp + notification worker (#21) = **P7/MSG91**. Seed `kyc:*`
  perms + enable RBAC (OFF by default — `RBAC-ENABLEMENT.md`). target-config/banner JSON-blob normalization (#18 resid).

ROLE & OPERATING MODEL (owner-agreed): you ORCHESTRATE, plan, GATE, own docs. **Per task: plan (Opus) → execute
(Sonnet executor, run in background; they have NO shell — you run the gate) → ONE independent adversarial audit
(Sonnet, Read/Grep — also no shell) → Opus gates → commit.** AUDIT EVERYTHING — don't risk-tier (audits this session
caught real DOUBLE-SPEND/oversell bugs in the redemption money-path that tsc+tests missed; also cross-tenant keys,
tx-escaping notifications, half-commits). Parallelize streams that touch disjoint files; Opus owns `schema.prisma` +
migrations so executors never collide. The gate (run it YOURSELF): `cd api && npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --noEmit`
(0) + `npx jest <area>` + a boot smoke for new endpoints; for FE, `cd platform && npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` +
`npx vitest run <area>` (platform = **vitest**, not jest) + `node scripts/check-doc-consistency.mjs` GREEN. After a
task, re-run the full FE suite and diff failing FILES vs `reconcile/baseline-red-snapshot.txt` — **no NEW reds**.
Sweep docs (reconcile/gap-register/RESUME/00-MASTER-PLAN/memory) after every task. Protocol: `DOC-MAINTENANCE.md`.

CONSTRAINTS (must hold):
- WORK ON **develop**. **main = prod releases only — never push main.** **Commit/push ONLY when the owner asks.**
  Never expose secrets (grep/cut DB creds without echoing). ⚠️ Don't `git add -A` while a background FE executor is
  mid-write — it sweeps half-written files into the wrong commit (happened in P5; recoverable, local-only, but messy).
- DEV DB = Cloud SQL `gifsy-db-dev` via Auth Proxy on **127.0.0.1:5433** / `gifsy_dev` (drops after reboot — restart
  per `DEV-DB.md`). **`SELECT 1` + confirm `current_database='gifsy_dev'` before migrating.** NEVER point dev at prod.
  **NEVER `prisma migrate dev`** (RESETS gifsy_dev) — use guarded SQL via `prisma db execute --file` (no `--schema`
  flag in Prisma 7; URL comes from `prisma.config.ts`) in `api/prisma/migrations-manual/`, txn-guarded by
  `current_database='gifsy_dev'`. **`ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE` must run OUTSIDE a transaction** (see
  `P3_doctype_split.sql` / `P5_wallet_rewards_additive.sql` for the proven shape). **SHOW migration SQL
  (independently audited) + WAIT for owner go before applying.** Never `DEMO_MODE` in staging/prod.
- ⚠️ **SCHEMA SOURCE OF TRUTH = `api/prisma/schema.prisma`** (P5 added `OtpPurpose.REDEMPTION_CONFIRM`,
  `RewardCatalog.stockQuantity`, `RedemptionOrder.voucherCode/voucherProvider`). `platform/prisma/schema.prisma` is
  stale — retires ~P6.
- CI is red-by-design (TDD-baseline fails) — gate is DIFFERENTIAL ("no NEW reds vs the snapshot").
- ⚠️ **Backend dev gotchas (recur on restart):** (1) `api/.env` was once found pointing at **PROD (`gifsy_prod`)** —
  re-verify it reads `127.0.0.1:5433/gifsy_dev` before any DB op. (2) The dev backend runs a compiled `dist/`; new
  code needs a rebuild, and repeated `tsc --noEmit` gate runs **poison `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`** so `nest build` emits
  nothing → rebuild with `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --incremental false`, then `node dist/main.js`. (3) The owner
  already runs servers; a stale backend may hold :4000 (`EADDRINUSE`) — find the PID
  (`Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 4000`) + `Stop-Process` before starting the fresh build. Platform :3000 is Next
  dev (serves FE live from disk — no restart needed for FE changes).

Reload (read before building):
- docs/plans/00-MASTER-PLAN.md            (phases; **P0–P5 + S DONE**; **§P6 = NEXT**)
- docs/plans/MODEL-ALIGNMENT.md           (the REAL parameter model)
- docs/plans/reconcile/{P5-wallet-points-rewards,P4-programs-targets-enrollment,P3-onboarding-kyc}.md  (build records)
- docs/plans/08-agent-execution-guide.md · GIT-WORKFLOW.md · DEV-DB.md · DOC-MAINTENANCE.md · RBAC-ENABLEMENT.md
- docs/spec/gap-register.md               (open gaps; 19 resolved; P6 magnets = #16 + #7/#8/#19/#25)
- memory: [[p5-complete]] · [[p4-complete]] · [[p3-kyc-complete]] · [[architecture-backend-split]] · [[platform-real-model]] · [[reconcile-fit-before-build]] · [[own-consistency-no-micromanage]]

Local: dev-DB Auth Proxy on 127.0.0.1:5433 (restart per DEV-DB.md); platform on :3000 (Next dev) + backend on :4000
(rebuild `dist` + `node dist/main.js`). Drive the live app via the Chrome extension (not preview_start). Confirm on
`develop` + dev DB reachable. Before any migration/irreversible step, show the SQL/plan (independently audited) + wait.
